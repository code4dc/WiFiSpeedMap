# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com).

I am using [RubyMine]
instead of [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
as my editor/IDE. Check out tips on using RubyMine in this project's
[wiki](https://github.com/perfectionist/sample_project/wiki)

For editing Markdown there are a number of options. Just go to Mac App Store and search
for **[markdown]**.  **[Mou]** is not at the MAS but is availiable
and is free.  I personally like a combination of **[Multimarkdown Composer]** and **[Marked]**
 and both are available from the MAS. **[Marked]** is just a previewer and
 works with any editor, plus it has a
 **[GitHub]** style for previewing. **Multimarkdown Composer** handles both Markdown and
 Multimarkdown syntax.  GitHub's syntax is in between but closer to [Multimarkdown].
 There is even a **[Markdown]** plugin for [RubyMine] which I am using for editing
 this `README.md` file.
